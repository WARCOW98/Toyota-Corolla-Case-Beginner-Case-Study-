# Toyota Corolla Data Preprocessing Case Study

This beginner-friendly project explores foundational data preprocessing techniques using the Toyota Corolla dataset. It is part of an academic assignment aimed at introducing key steps in preparing data for machine learning models.

## 📊 Overview

The dataset contains 1,436 records of Toyota Corolla vehicles with 39 attributes related to pricing, specifications, and performance.

### Key Tasks Covered:
- Dataset summarization
- Normalization of continuous variables (KM)
- Creation of dummy variables for categorical features (Fuel Type)
- Partitioning the data into training, validation, and test sets

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Understand how to prepare a dataset for machine learning
- Gain experience with feature engineering and splitting strategies
- Develop intuition around data cleaning and preprocessing

## 🚀 Getting Started
To replicate this case study:
1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Follow the steps for cleaning, transformation, and splitting.
3. Use the partitioned data to build and test predictive models.
